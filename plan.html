  <h1>CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Suman Khanal</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The 100SMILES Dental Care website aims to boost new patient bookings by 20% within the first six months. The site will serve as an easy-to-use online platform that showcases the clinic’s services, special offers, and key information. Its purpose is to reach more families and individuals in the Razole area, making it simpler for them to book appointments and learn about dental care ultimately helping the clinic grow its patient base and business.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Success will be determined by tracking the number of new patient appointments made through the website over a six-month period and comparing it with current booking figures. The goal is to achieve at least a 20% increase. Additionally, an increase in email inquiries from the site will be monitored as another indicator that the website is successfully attracting new clients.</p>
  
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The primary audience includes families with children and adults under 40 living in Razole who need regular or emergency dental care. The website will feature a friendly and inviting design, using bright colors, family-focused visuals, and clear “Book Now” buttons. It will also include information about children’s dental care to make it especially appealing to families.</p>
